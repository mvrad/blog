## About
- My personal blog where I talk about web development, discoveries and breakthroughs in science and engineering, movie reviews, and pretty much anything that I find interesting enough to write about.

## Under the Hood
Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, Laravel, and ButterCMS.

You can take all the files of this site and run them on your computer as if it were live online, only it's just on your machine. This project utilizes the [ButterCMS API](https://buttercms.com/) to retrieve blog posts.

### Requirements
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

First, copy the repository's files from here onto your computer and to view and serve those files locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/mvrad/blog.git
```
Open the files in a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and, if you have access to [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), in the terminal and Composer installed, in a terminal in the project's root directory type:
```bash
composer install
composer update
```
After installing Homestead, configuring the Homestead.yaml file and updating your machine's hosts file, you can now launch the Vagrant VM from within the Homestead directory in the terminal with:
```bash
vagrant up
```
Note: You'll also need to create a *config.js* file in the public/js directory containing your ButterCMS API key:
```javascript
const config = {
  KEY : "api_key"
};
```
Note: You will need an environment (.env) file. You can find an example of this at [github.com/laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/.env.example). After you create the .env file, enter this command in the terminal:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
The APP_KEY in the .env file must match the key generated by this command. If everything went well, you should now be able to visit *blog.test* in the browser.
